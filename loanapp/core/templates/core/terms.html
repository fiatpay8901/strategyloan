      <p class="dark-text-white"><strong>Last Updated: Jan 2, 2025</strong></p>

      <p class="dark-text-white">Welcome to Strategy Loan, a leading crypto-based loan platform that empowers individuals and businesses through accessible digital financial services. These Terms and Conditions outline your rights, responsibilities, and obligations when using our platform. Please read them carefully before using our services. By accessing Strategy Loan, you agree to comply with these Terms in full. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you should not access or use our services.</p>

      <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">Strategy Loan (“we”, “our”, “us”) offers digital lending services where users can apply for loans using cryptocurrency as collateral. Our services include, but are not limited to, loan applications, collateral management, repayments, digital wallet integrations, deposits, withdrawals, KYC processing, and more. By using our website and applications, you confirm your understanding and agreement to be bound by these Terms.</p>

      <h4>2. Eligibility</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">To use Strategy Loan, you must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher. You must have full legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. We may request identification documents and other proof of eligibility during the registration or KYC process. Strategy Loan reserves the right to deny access to any individual who does not meet eligibility requirements or fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

      <h4>3. Account Creation and Security</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">Creating an account requires providing accurate and current personal information. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your login credentials, including email and password. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account, notify us immediately. Strategy Loan is not responsible for any losses arising from unauthorized access resulting from your failure to secure your account.</p>

      <h4>4. KYC and Compliance</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">We follow strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures in compliance with international standards. All users must complete identity verification before accessing financial services. This includes submitting documents such as government-issued IDs, proof of address, and selfies. Strategy Loan retains the right to suspend or limit access if you fail to complete verification or provide false or misleading information.</p>

      <h4>5. Crypto Collateral and Loan Services</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">Our loan services are crypto-collateralized, meaning users must deposit accepted cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, etc.) to secure a loan. Collateral value must meet or exceed the required loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Failure to maintain the LTV threshold due to market volatility may result in a margin call or liquidation. Loans are subject to interest rates based on the amount, duration, and risk class. Repayment must be made on or before the due date. Early repayment is encouraged and free from penalties.</p>

      <h4>6. Deposits, Withdrawals, and Wallets</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">You may fund your Strategy Loan wallet using fiat or crypto. We process withdrawals to verified addresses or bank accounts only. It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy of provided wallet addresses. Strategy Loan is not liable for lost funds due to incorrect address input or third-party wallet issues. Deposits and withdrawals may be delayed due to network congestion or compliance checks.</p>

      <h4>7. Security Measures</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">We use industry-leading security practices, including end-to-end encryption, multi-layered authentication, two-factor authentication (2FA), and cold wallet storage for crypto assets. Despite our best efforts, no system is entirely immune to risks. You agree that Strategy Loan is not liable for damages resulting from security breaches beyond our control.</p>

      <h4>8. User Conduct</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">You agree not to use Strategy Loan for any unlawful, fraudulent, or abusive purpose. Prohibited activities include attempting to hack, reverse engineer, manipulate loan parameters, or impersonate other users. We may suspend or terminate your account for violating these rules without prior notice.</p>

      <h4>9. Intellectual Property</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">All content on our platform, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, UI/UX design, and software, is the property of Strategy Loan or our partners. You may not copy, distribute, or modify any part of the platform without express written permission.</p>

      <h4>10. Fees and Charges</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">All applicable fees are clearly disclosed before transaction confirmation. These may include service charges, interest rates, blockchain network fees, and administrative charges. You agree to pay all fees associated with your use of Strategy Loan’s services.</p>

      <h4>11. Termination and Suspension</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to your account at any time, with or without cause, and without liability. Reasons may include violation of these Terms, suspected fraudulent activity, non-compliance with legal requirements, or inactivity over an extended period.</p>

      <h4>12. Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">To the maximum extent permitted by law, Strategy Loan shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of or inability to use our platform. This includes losses due to cryptocurrency market volatility, data breaches, service downtime, or third-party actions.</p>

      <h4>13. Governing Law</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Insert Jurisdiction/Country]. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction.</p>

      <h4>14. Changes to Terms</h4>
      <p class="dark-text-white">We may update these Terms at any time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through email or an in-app notice. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.</p>
